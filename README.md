# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

_________________

Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/dynamic-user-interface-interactions).

This project is just a refresher from all the JavaScript projects from Odin Website. 
I decided to do it since I never really pay attention into creating these things and I know they are mostly used when creating a website.

> I know they are not the best and you can probably find a lot of example project of these on the Internet.
